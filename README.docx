                     CHAPTER ONE

                          
1.0 Introduction
Because of the worldwide impact of online auction marketplaces, sellers and buyers can bypass geographical barriers and purchase things from anywhere on the internet at any time. When compared to traditional physical markets, the online auction market offers consumers significant benefits such as lower costs, a larger product range, and more efficiency (Song, Y., Escobar, O., Arzubiaga, U., & De Massis, A., 2022). The usage of an online auction system makes use of a decision-making aid tool, which gives buyers more confidence in their choice of seller and product. The product information signals, seller rating scores, and seller shilling actions make up the decision-making aid tool.
The product information signals use text and pictures to thoroughly define the product, as well as third-party product certifications, descriptions of product attributes, product usage, and book value. This aims to give the buyer confidence in the goods. By utilizing feedback scores, the decision-making aid tool also gives seller ratings. Previous winning bidders provide this feedback, which is used to assess the online auction goods sellers. These bidders provide extensive seller ratings and scores for all elements of the seller, such as how accurate the item description was, how satisfied they were with the seller's communication, and how soon the seller delivered the things to them.
The procedure of determining seller's shill ratings is another significant part of the decision-making tool. Shilling is the practice of inserting fictitious bids into an auction on behalf of the seller in order to artificially boost the price of an item (Trevathan, J, 2018). The algorithm uses shill behavior features, such as those bidders that make a lot of failed bids on the same seller, to determine shill grade. Shills have a higher percentage of unsuccessful bids per seller. The auction company keeps track of how many bids a bidder has submitted for each seller with whom he or she has dealt. A shill score is calculated using this information.

 


1.1 Background Information

Online auction platforms have exploded in popularity in recent years. Entrepreneurs and customers alike would benefit greatly from online auctions. They provide a centralized marketplace where buyers and sellers may bid on and sell almost anything. Bidding on auction websites is both convenient and economical. The majority of auction platforms offer automatic bidding with a wide range of listing categories and options. Subcategories. Buyers and sellers will be able to deal in real time as a result of this. Portals for auctions are becoming increasingly popular.

The e-marketplace is built on an innovative software solution that keeps bidders and sellers safe. Furthermore, in order to maintain a successful website, reputable online auction websites always focus on ease of navigation.



The search for items has always been a mind-chewing activity to most people in the country and in the whole globe. People are always on the go to their renown product supplier, or nearby market center or at times a local hawkers, who goes on to supply items and at times when he cannot get the item the buyer wants, mostly they give their hands to get them items and at times they mess and bring fake and quarks deliver stolen and bad items. This is because unqualified people offer delivery of items to customers.
Some people also spend a lot of time and money on transportation, of which at the end of the road they might lack to get the desired items which they opted for. It is open that most people are seeking to buy items every day locally, desperate if they might get a solution, or a right person to deliver a solution to them. These people end up settling at items or service providers who are con men or who sell illegal and fake items to the desperate buyers. On the other hand, there are legit business people and store owners who have quality items in the locality of the auctioneer, but they do not meet for business because the auctioneer is not informed about the items available.
Due to the disparity of the buyers, con-men have always taken the advantage to offer item delivery to the customers. Many fake items have found their way into the hands of the people, or buyers remain in the same condition of lack, as they don’t get the right items from the sellers. Sometimes buyers struggle to find the right items, in failure, and they seek to get back to their homes. On the other hand, we have suppliers and business people who are qualified to supply and sell the items yet they have very few people who can come to them, more so in the same locality.
This does sound terrible. This project shall handle this issue by creating an online platform where a user will be able to post items online for auction. The items will accompany item name, selling price, and a picture presentation for the bidder to see (Massey et al., n.d.). The bidder, if interested in the item, will auction for the product and will be able to inspect the item physically to approve the product then complete the Online Auction Management System the business with the seller after the bidding process is done. This is important since the auctioneer does not necessarily need to make a physical consultation with the seller for him/ her to get the required services.
The item to be sold is accompanied with images that help the bidder to identify whether that is the product that they really need. A video of the item in use is also provided if applicable. This makes sure that bidders don’t end up wasting time and energy purchasing an item and then raise claims.
The auctioneer will have a provision to chat with the seller and consult with him about the details of the product.
This chat will be confidential only between the buyer and the seller, ensuring the buyer’s confidentiality. The customers will be assured of getting the right products, since they will take their time to analyze and compare a range of listed items and choose appropriately according to their need or desire. This will save time that buyers take in search of items and therefore they will save themselves from worsening conditions which may lead to wastage of time conditions.
This will also save money that is spent around traveling and bidding for the undesired items. Bidders will at the end of the day have a reason to smile with this online system. This system will run on the internet since of the dynamic nature of the internet, and anybody can access it from smartphones, computers, personal digital assistants and many more digital gadgets. This is a sure promise that the system will serve many people in the country, and in the future it will reach out to the whole world. 
Auctions were held at auction houses a few decades later, and bids were made with the auctioneer delegating the bids. This approach required the personal presence of the bidders, which had a number of drawbacks. As a result, online auctioning was developed, allowing auctions to be conducted via the internet from anywhere in the globe. Due to a lack of effective product and seller evaluation methodologies, the introduction of online auctions has its own set of drawbacks. The existing systems do not allow for a comprehensive description of the types of sellers and the products they offer. These systems don't give you enough information to assess the different types of merchants and their products. As a result of the purchasers' uncertainty, the efficacy of online auctions is lessened, prompting individuals to seek out offline auction platforms. 
The majority of currently available auction systems do not completely describe products or evaluate the various types of sellers who participate in the auctioning process. Online systems are based on the assumption that there is no comprehensive review of the shilling actions that occur in various auction systems. The assessment of shilling actions goes a long way toward ensuring certainty in the various types of sellers. In an auction system, this can be accomplished by providing shill scores or shill ratings for each vendor. Different bidders may simply make decisions for the different vendors they decide to bid for their products by providing the sellers with a shill rating.

1.2 Problem Statement
Due to the lack of physical examination of the products, the buyer's uncertainty about the sellers and their products is a common concern in online auctions (Pavlov & Dimoka, 2008a). Despite the numerous advantages of online auctions, there are still issues. Unlike in offline markets, where buyers can physically evaluate product quality and interact directly with sellers, buyers in online markets do not have this opportunity because they can only evaluate product quality through an internet interface that cannot perfectly describe the products (Melnik & Richardson, 2010). The product difficulty, as well as the seller's uncertainties, have a detrimental impact on the essential success of online auction outcomes. The use of an online auction system that includes thorough seller and product descriptions gives bidders more confidence in their choices of products and sellers.


1. 3 General Research Objectives
    1. To develop an online auction system which will provide a forum for sellers to meet and interact with buyers, and sell items to interested bidders.
    2. To generate reports for each completed bid in the auction system
    3. To design and implement an online auction system that ensures the buyers' trust in the vendors and the auctioned objects.
    4.  To compute the seller’s ratings using the feedback scores from the bid winners
    5. To notify the bidders of new bids made in the bids that they participate in.
    6. To compute the seller’s shill scores for each seller that sells products on the online auction system.
1.4 Specific Objectives
The Online auction management system shall accomplish the following as way of achieving the major goal:
1. To allow bidders to auction for items posted by sellers through the system.
2. To allow bidders to purchase items from their desired seller.
3. To allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other.
4. To allow sellers to generate a report of goods sold.

1.5 Justification of the Study
Increased product and seller uncertainty occur from the usage of online auction systems that do not allow for a complete and effective product description and do not provide decision-making aid tools to online bidders. Because buyers are unsure about the product and the seller, it is difficult for them to distinguish between good and bad sellers. This lack of differentiation may force higher quality sellers to leave the market because their quality products do not signal and reward with fair prices, resulting in lower transaction activity (Pavlou & Dimoka, 2008b).
The goal of this new approach is to increase consumer confidence in the type of seller and products they select to bid on. By employing effective information such as visual and verbal product descriptions, third-party product certification, product book value, and product usage. The successful implementation of this project resulted in an online auction system that enables for significantly more effective product evaluations that come near to or match physical product evaluations.
 


1.6 Scope of the Study
The only items that can be auctioned on this online auction system are household furnishings, computers, computer equipment, and cell phones. This system is intended for buyers and sellers who are residents of Meru University. The auctioning procedure is only open to registered potential buyers and sellers.
1. 7 Assumptions in the field
1. The users have a device capable of connecting to the internet
2. There will be users to test the application
3. The resources used to build this application are free and open source.
4. The project scope is expected to change within the development period.
5. The project follows a rapid development methodology.

1.8 Limitations of the Study
1.8.1 Threat Vectors Pose a Security Risk
One of the most significant drawbacks of the e-auction process is cyber-attacks. Businesses are subjected to malicious attacks at a rate of one every 39 seconds, according to studies conducted by the University of Maryland. Unlike in the past, when procurement teams would phone suppliers and discuss bids, everything is now digital, making it easier for cyber terrorists to target businesses. This problem can be solved by having security policies in place and also penalties for those who don’t adhere to them.

1.8.2. Price is a major motivator for many people.
The nature of auctions, both traditional and digital, is that they are centered on price. Because price is generally the primary motivator, e-auction becomes a restriction. In general, the lower a supplier's pricing, the more likely it is that the contract will be awarded to them. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing for procurement teams wanting to save money on purchases, it shouldn't be the only consideration.

                                                Chapter 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
This chapter primarily examines the current online auction systems in use, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the evolution of auction systems as well as an explanation of their general structure.
This chapter will examine the many types of systems that are accessible and explain how the new system differs from the rest of the systems and why it is beneficial to design such a system. The system that is being built tackles a variety of flaws in the current system, culminating in the creation of a more efficient online auction system.

2.1 An Overview of Auction Systems
Electronic markets, particularly those that are based on the internet, have grown in popularity as platforms for conducting business transactions (Pinker et al., 2001). Indeed, it may be claimed that auction-based electronic markets best reflect the commercial shifts brought on by e-commerce. Auction systems are an important part of the electronic marketplace since they allow users to sell and buy things from any location. The sellers hold auctions for their various products, and the buyer with the highest bid wins the right to acquire the product in an auction.
In general, auction systems employ a variety of agents; the most prevalent types of agents are Purchaser Agents, Seller Agents, and Facilitator Agents. The Seller Agent, on the other hand, assists sellers in registering goods for auction. This layout increases the chances of the auctioned item selling. The Purchaser Agent is the second agent, which requires bidding to buy and recommends a reasonable bidding price based on the bidding competitor's bidding history. The third agent is the Facilitator Agent, who acts as an auctioneer and allows a bidder to view the auction history of another person while bidding on and purchasing a goods.
The auction system is controlled by a network of host computers. Clients use one of these computers to access the auction system. Clients can use the system to buy and sell products through auctions.
2.1.1 Evolution of Auction Systems
In the early days of auctions, it was not the most prevalent method of negotiating the purchase of products or commodities. It went unnoticed since most people preferred to buy at a fixed price. Prior to the seventeenth century, there were only a few auctions held on a periodic basis. Auctions, on the other hand, have a long history, dating back to 500 B.C. Annual women's marriage auctions were held in Babylon, according to Herodotus. The auctions started with the most gorgeous woman the auctioneer could find and moved to the least attractive. Allowing a daughter to be sold outside of an auction was considered illegal.
Even during the Roman Empire, auctions were popular. Later, slaves were frequently abducted and auctioned in the forum under the symbol of the spear, with the revenues going to the war effort.
Auctions have evolved tremendously over the years, and now they are conducted entirely online. Online auctions come in a variety of formats, including g English auctions, descending Dutch auctions, first-price sealed-bid, and Vickrey auctions. Due to the quick rise in popularity of the type of electronic commerce, online auctions were expected to account for 30% of all online e-commerce in 2002 (Korgaonkar et al., 2010).






2.2 Components of an Online Product Auction System
There are 4 components or modules in the online auction system:
2.2.1 Authentication Module
The authentication module is where the user's identity is verified. Validation is another term for authentication. In order to move further, the buyer/seller must first register in this module. Separate authentication procedures exist for the buyer and seller. The user is not validated if the submitted information does not fulfill the criteria.

2.2.2 Buyer Module
The buyer can visit the site using this module. To apply the bid, the buyer must first log into the system and purchase bid points before bidding on the product. If the buyer wants to purchase the item, he can use the bid. The buyer will receive the product if the bid is unique and large. When the buyer has won the product, he must pay the system.

2.2.3 Seller Module
This module requires the seller to log into the system and register his product for auction. When the auction is finished, the administrator tells the seller of the buyer's information so that the merchandise can be handed over to the system. The system sends the money to the seller.

2.2.4 Administrator Module
The admin module handles all of the tasks that allow a user to bid on an item with ease. The categories will be created and updated by the administrator. We can locate various products up for auction under the various categories. All information about the products in each category will be handled by the administrator. All acts taken by users will be the responsibility of the administrator. Admins have the ability to block users and adjust their rights. The admin has the ability to delete categories and items that are up for sale. Inventory management is the responsibility of the administrator.

2.3 Types of Auction Systems
The auction system is controlled by a network of host computers. Clients use one of these computers to access the auction system. Clients can use the system to buy and sell products through auctions. The English auction, Dutch auction, first-price sealed-bid auction, and second-price sealed-bid auction are the four main types of auctions (also known as Vickrey auction).

2.3.1 English Auctions
The English auction is one of the most well-known and widely used types of auction. The things for sale are placed up for auction in an English auction starting at a relatively modest minimum price, and buyers are then free to enter their bids until the auction closes. These auctions are held for a set amount of time, which might range from hours to days. The auction time period is set each time a new bid item is registered, the auction finishes, and the time-out expires (Dong et al., 2009) The English auction is the most ideal sort of auction for this project because of its simplicity, which allows it to be understood by a wide range of people.
English auctions are the most well-known third-party on-line auction format, and they are thought to be the most straightforward of all the options. The bids are on display for all potential participants to see. In an English auction, the highest bidder is declared the winner. Most consumers prefer the English auction because it employs a system that they are familiar with and comfortable with, lowering transaction costs.


2.3.2 Dutch Auctions
The auctioneer starts with a high opening bid and gradually reduces it until one of the bidders accepts the auctioneer's price or the seller's reserve price is met. The things for sale are distributed in order of highest bid, with the first highest bidder selecting their stuff, followed by the second highest bidder, and so on until the order is exhausted. Perishable commodities such as flowers, seafood, and tobacco, as well as investment instruments, are auctioned in the Netherlands (Xu et al., 2008).
2.3.3 First-Price Sealed-Bid
First-price enclosed bid auctions are those in which each bidder places a single bid and the bid price is kept hidden throughout the auction. The first price sealed-bid auction is an auction whereby all bidders submit their bids at the same time and no one knows what the other bidders are thinking. The highest bidder is declared the winner, and that bid is paid. In a first-price sealed-bid auction, all bidding parties make a single bid, and the highest bidder wins and pays the amount bid. The fundamental difference between First-price sealed bid and English auctions is that bids are not publicly visible or stated, whereas public bids stimulate competition. 
2.3.4 Vickrey Auction
Vickrey auctions, also known as second-price sealed-bid auctions, operate on the same principles as first-price sealed bid auctions. The top bidder and winner, on the other hand, will only pay the amount bid by the second highest bidder. The Vickrey auction is recommended to eliminate the motivation for purchasers to bid strategically by requiring them to speak the truth by stating the item's genuine value.
2.3.5 Reverse Auction
The roles of buyer and seller are reversed in reverse auctions. As additional bids are made, prices often decline as multiple sellers fight for the buyer's business. They differ from traditional auctions in that the buyer can view all of the offers and choose which one they like. Reverse auctions are mostly utilized in the business world for procurement. In a transparent economy, reverse auctions bring buyers and sellers together. On the online auction site, the concept has even been applied to private jet travel. Skies of Marmalade (Zavodovski et al., 2019).
Unique bid auctions, which are more analogous to traditional auctions in that there is only one seller and several purchasers, are frequently confused with reverse auctions. They do, however, follow a similar price reduction idea, with the exception that the lowest individual bid always wins, and each bid is kept private.
English auctions, Dutch auctions, 1st Price auctions, and 2nd Price auctions are among the types of auctions supported. The most well-known type of auction is the English auction. The thing for sale is auctioned off starting at a low minimum bid price. Bidders can then continue to put bids until the auction ends. The period of the auction is sometimes determined in advance, such as 30 days, or the auction can be coupled with a time-out value. The time-out is refreshed each time a new bid is submitted. When the timer runs out, the auction ends.


2.4 Challenges encountered during development of an online product auction system
2.4.1 Shilling Activities in Auction Systems
One of the most common fraud activities that occur in most auctions is what is known as shilling. Shill bidding is the act of introducing fake bids into an auction on behalf of the to artificially inflate the price of an item. The seller can either register as a bidder under a false identity or be in collusion with one or more of the bidders. These fake bidders who engage in shilling are referred to as shills.  This online auction system strives to provide a way to determine and detect any shilling activities that may be carried out. This can be achieved by examining bidding information across several auctions and producing a score indicating the likelihood that the bidder is engaging in shill behavior.
 
2.4.2Shill Behavior and Characteristics
The major aim for the process of shilling is to artificially inflate the price for a particular seller. The major gain for the seller is the difference between the final price and the inflated price. The shill’s main goal is to lose each auction that they participate in. Shills normally have the same characteristics as they all have similar goals.
The following are the characteristics of Shills:
 Shills usually participate in particular auctions only held by one particular seller; however this may not be sufficient enough to rule one as a shill as the seller may the only supplier of the item.
  A shill is also characterized by a few or no wins for the bids that they participate in a shill’s goal is to try and stimulate bidding. As a result, a shill will tend to bid more near the beginning of an auction. This entails that a shill can influence the entire auction process and furthermore shills avoid bidding towards the end of an auction as it is risky as their main goal is to avoid winning the bid.
 A shill usually bids the minimum amount required to outbid   a legitimate bidder. If the shill bids an amount that is much higher than the current highest bid, it is unlikely that a legitimate bidder will enter more bids and this results in the shill winning the shill winning the bid
The most extreme shill bidding strategy is referred to as aggressive shilling. An aggressive shill usually continually outbids everyone thereby driving up the price as much as possible.

2.5 Related studies
A study conducted by Manduna R Manduna, (2015), shows that eBay's buyers and sellers can leave feedback about their experiences with each other. However, while buyers can give sellers a positive, neutral or negative rating plus a short comment, sellers can give buyers only a positive rating and a short comment. This presents a number of problems as there is a need for a detailed feedback rating as there are different aspects of a seller that have to be looked at. There is a need to evaluate the quality of sellers' products, the efficiency of their delivery and other aspects. The use of a positive, negative and neutral value does not give enough information about the type of seller. The approach provides far more extensive feedback scores that analyze numerous characteristics of the sellers, assigning ten-point values to each area, and using the total score to establish the seller's overall feedback score. The product quality, the efficiency of the seller's delivery time, how well the product descriptions on the auction reflect the genuine product, and product functionality (if the thing works well) will all be evaluated in the feedback.
According to a study conducted by (Tyagi, 2020) on eBay online auction, once a seller gets negative study he or she is allowed to dispute it and also given a chance to change, the online auction system we are creating will only allow a seller to get negative feedback only thrice, that is if it is their fault for the negative feedback then they are disqualified from using the system.
(Chen & Li, 2020) treat eBay auctions as a sequence of sealed bid, second-price auctions of heterogeneous goods. A random number of buyers enter each period and, if they lose or choose not to bid, either exit or go into hibernation for a random number of periods. (Tyagi, 2020)) propose a model in which a continuum of sellers and buyers enter each period, are randomly matched in sealed bid, second-price auctions, and exit only when they trade.
(Massey et al., n.d.) develops a model like ours, but she assumes that when bidders arrive, they are matched to the soonest-to-close auction in which the posted price is less than their optimal bid, and that they bid in that auction as if it is a sealed bid auction. In each of these models, the price or winning bid in an auction can be treated as a second or first order statistic from a random set of buyers. As a result, the models in these papers can be identified and estimated using only data on prices or winning bids. Our contribution consists of developing a model that is arguably a better approximation to the data-generating mechanism, providing conditions under which it is identified, and showing how it can be estimated. The distinguishing features of our model are that the auctions are overlapping and open. These features imply that the matching of buyers to sellers is endogenous. When bidders arrive, they observe the posted prices and closing times of the auctions and bid in the auction that is the best match for them.5 This sorting means that the price and winning bid in an auction cannot be treated as realizations of second or first order statistics, since bidders with the highest values among a set of bidders who arrive during a period often choose to bid in different auctions. The sorting can also generate dependence between a buyer’s bid and maximum rival bid.
 
(Dong et al., 2009) conducted a study on a consumer search setting in which all buyers have the same value for the good but face different deadlines for procuring it. In their model, a buyer increases her bid and is more likely to buy from a fixed-price listing as her deadline approaches. They show that bidder behavior in eBay markets is consistent with these predictions. Our paper provides a framework for evaluating the extensive structural literature that models eBay auctions as a sequence of independent, static games with exogenous participation. The results suggest this may not be a good approximation. First, by ignoring the distinction between new and returning buyers, these papers implicitly treat the stationary distribution of buyer values as the primitive rather than the distribution of new buyer values. This matters for counterfactuals (e.g., higher reserve prices) since changes in the auction mechanism will lead to a different stationary distribution of buyer values. Second, by ignoring the overlapping structure of the auctions, they fail to account for buyers choosing an auction based on the state of play. We find that the selection effects from endogenous participation have a significant impact on our estimates of the distributions of buyer values. Finally, by ignoring the option to bid again, they overestimate the values of the bidders, although our results suggest that this effect may be second-order.

This  paper contributes to the empirical literature on search-and-bargaining models of trade, such as in studies of the market for used aircraft(Brancaccio et al., 2020)study of global shipping, and (Buchholz, 2017). These papers approximate markets with finite numbers of buyers and sellers with a continuum of agents. They focus on the steady state of the dynamic market and use the restrictions on entry and exit flows as the basis for estimating the models’ primitives. By contrast, we work with the stationary state of a finite market, and we use the restrictions on flows as over-identifying tests of our model.
 The existing online Auction by (Tyagi, 2020) has very important modules, it has a secure registration system and a profile management of the user, complete search /site map of the user entire site for easy access, admins are also able to control the product auctioned.
However, this system lacks the chatting system functionality. It is important to provide buyers and sellers a chat room where they will have a conversation regarding a specific system. Buyers and sellers connecting with each other create trust between the two. This proposed  system has a chat room that will enable a private conversation between sellers and buyers.
 According to (Tyagi, 2020)security is one of the key things to consider when developing an online auction system.  In this existing system, you are required to register and then login to access the Online auction system.
The main drawback of this system is the means of user verification to confirm that he/she is the true owner of the account. The system does not give a particular method for verification of owners identity therefore it fails in giving a secure online business.
The proposed online property auction system, a generated code will be sent to the user's email where he/she will be required to click it. On clicking he/she will be allowed to access system.
(Madhuri et al., 2020) noted that online sell off is one of the well-known online business exercises that allows bidders to legitimately offer their products over the Internet. The fact that an outsider plays an important role in the bartering between buyers and sellers fa the cilitates transactions. When looking for the best offering tactics to exceed expectations in the focused condition of several and concurrent online sales for the same or similar products, bidders are regularly put to the test.
 
The administrations have gently modified people's everyday lives as a result of the Internet's frenzy, for example, in sectors such as web-based business activities on exchanges, transportation, and so forth. They also suggest that operators who use a dissuading relapse technique outperform existing professionals in a variety of contexts. Bidders must navigate a maze of options when deciding which closeout to participate in, whether to bid early or late, and how much to give. They propose the plan of offering strategies in that framework, which aims to forecast the offer amounts for buyers at a certain point in time based on their offering behavior and the value of an unloaded product.
 
(Pinker et al., 2001)) examines the evolution of e-commerce in the realm of online auctions' intelligent information systems. Their shortcomings, benefits, services, security systems, and online payment methods are all listed. In addition, developing technologies for measuring the success of trading systems for online auctions was an important aspect of the project. They also addressed several difficulties related to the development of intelligent information systems. The main successes and issues in the field of Internet auctions and the usage of e-commerce technology are examined in this paper.
 
The idea of Intelligent Information System Internet auction, as well as schemes of work of users with similar systems, and the construction of intelligent information system Internet auction based on e-commerce servers, demonstrate the authors' recommendations in practice. The findings can be used for other advancements and projects in the field of developing e-commerce-based systems on the Internet.
 
(Chen & Li, 2020)conducted a study motivated by the emergence of online service outsourcing platforms where buyer-determined auctions are commonly used as the service trading mechanism and review systems are provided to facilitate transaction trust. They developed a game-theoretical model of online service outsourcing auctions with endogenous reviews. In the model, the client first announces the service scope and the penalty in case of low-quality delivery, and then interested freelancers possessing private information about their service expertise bid the service prices. The client selects one winning freelancer on the buyer-determined basis, and the winning freelancer exerts efforts to improve the service quality, anticipating the client’s ex post review behavior.
(Liu et al., 2020) conducted a study on the online auction system and modeled three online advertising auction channels through which a demand side platform could submit bid prices. These models were helpful for supply side platforms in their development of strategies for different reserved prices and channels, which was beneficial to make strategies of SSPs, especially multi channels.
The study concluded that exogenous bidding channel was a traditional way to submit bids; its advantage was that there were no extra costs or fees, but its use may cost the supply side platforms more time than would the other channels. With the increasing demands of quick deals, the traditional way faced the risk of becoming obsolete. The channel of bidding involved costly information acquisition not only facilitated the presentation of bidding prices but also enabled the receipt of fees for the cost of information.
(Dyyak et al., 2020) conducted a survey on a probabilistic mechanism design for online auctions and developed a probabilistic approach to design advertising mechanisms for e-commerce platforms. Simple mechanisms were introduced as useful tools for designing probabilistic mechanisms to keep the original equilibrium. They designed two kinds of probabilistic mechanisms based on the classical first-price and second-price mechanisms. Properties of the proposed probabilistic mechanisms were then investigated. Furthermore, they also implemented two algorithms to help design mechanisms for different application scenarios. Experiment results demonstrated the flexibility and performance of the probabilistic approach for auction platforms. The study concluded that this approach was useful especially if the e-commerce platform wanted to change the mechanism without affecting the strategies of bidders.

Summary
Internet auctions have been big news in recent years and much has been written about these compelling old/new exchange models, the eBay phenomenon, and the amazing Wall Street act. The popular press has been intense on explaining the new movement and helping buyers avoid getting ripped off Business news, much of which is produced by the companies themselves, has kept its eye on the steeply rising trend lines. Technology writing has taken for granted the goal of the "frictionless market", on society and even on the individual and even students. Some of these questions apply to all Internet commerce. But the Internet exchange is even more interactive and uses even more sophisticated data tracking and integration technology.
On one hand it allows sellers to know buyers' needs and wants, purchasing behavior, buying power, habits. On the other hand, it dramatically increases consumers' access to information. Surely the impact of this data explosion deserves more attention. More study is also required of what happens to businesses when they cannot be certain of the price, they will fetch for what they sell and the price they will pay for what they buy. How does this affect accounting, planning, earning expectations and many more professions? Relatively little attention has been paid to the legal questions that arise from increased use of electronic commerce in general, and exchanges in particular. Questions of jurisdiction, liability, accountability, and taxation abound, though perhaps the territory will only be explored in more real cases.




                                                  Chapter 3: METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
This chapter covers the many research and software development approaches that should be considered for this project, as well as those that will be employed in the creation of the online auction system. The term methodology refers to a methodical approach to carrying out all tasks by establishing a development framework. This chapter goes through the many approaches that can be employed for this project in detail. The purpose of this chapter is to look at various approaches and determine which one is best for constructing an online auction system. Software development approaches assist the development team in planning and organizing their work in a timely and efficient manner.
 
3.1 Research Methodologies
The structured procedure of conducting research is referred to as research methodology. Many different techniques are employed in different forms of research, although the phrase is commonly used to refer to research design, data collection, and data analysis. The study design, which is a part of the research methodology, is focused by how the study is carried out and often incorporates questionnaires, interviews, observations, and experiments. The term "research methodology," sometimes known as "research methods," refers to the procedures used to analyze and evaluate the data collected. To detect correlations or statistical significance in the results, these frequently employ a variety of advanced statistical analysis of the data. (Vaccaro, 2013). Experimental, theoretical, simulation, formal, and build approaches are the several types of research methodologies in computer science. In this chapter, many research methodologies are analyzed, and one methodology that best fits the online auction system will be chosen.



3.1.1 Formal Methodology
The formal methodology is one of the research methodologies which will be considered for this online auction project. Formal methodologies are commonly used in computer science to prove facts about algorithms and systems. The time complexity of the different auction bids and the correctness of the different algorithms used to generate the seller's quality and shill score calculations may be of interest to the researchers, and in the online auction this would include the time complexity of the different auction bids and the correctness of the different algorithms used to generate the seller's quality and shill score calculations. The formal technique is a theory- and math-based research process that is most commonly used in theoretical computer science. (Korgaonkar et al., 2010). This methodology isn't the greatest fit for this project because it doesn't focus on establishing truths about algorithms and the system. The online auction system does not rely on theoretical or algorithmic proofs, instead relying on feedback scores from winning bidders, shill scores generated for each seller, and information signals to determine the quality of the products and sellers.
 
3.1.2 Experimental Methodology
The experimental methodology is another study methodology that is explored for this project. This approach does not best suit the online auction system due to time constraints, as this project will be completed in a short period of time, and experimental methodology takes a significant amount of time, as well as the fact that if this approach is not carried out properly, it can result in inaccurate results. In computer science, experimental approaches are often employed to evaluate innovative solutions to issues. The explanatory step and the evaluation phase are frequently separated in experimental evaluation. The researcher will be taking measurements during the exploratory phase to assist identify the questions that should be asked about the system under examination. The explanatory phase of an online auction system involves determining the minimum and maximum time that should be allocated for each auction, the number of products that each seller should sell, the number of bids that each buyer can place, and the number of times that the same product can be resold in the same auction. The assessment step next tries to answer the concerns raised in the explanatory phase by offering answers, such as determining the maximum length of time an auction can run. A well-designed experiment begins with a list of the questions the experiment should answer.
The experimental technique necessitates meticulous record-keeping, which allows them to be retrieved and checked later. Most computer science researchers aren't very diligent when it comes to preserving records, therefore there's a need to be extra cautious. During the exploratory phase of an experimental project, speed is crucial. As a result, this step is generally handled with less attention than it should be. Once the exploratory phase is completed, a researcher should document the findings and meticulously detail the experimental setup, as well as the hardware and software features employed during the assessment phase.  In the experimental methodology it is important to document and report the experimental evaluation.
 
3.1.3 Simulation Methodology
By adjusting the difference parameter values and evaluating the effects of changing these parameters, the simulation methodology enables numerous ways to analyze the system. The simulation of an online auction system involves changing various parameters such as the number of bidders allowed per bid or the maximum amount of time allowed for each bid. After changing these parameters, the effects of changing these parameters are evaluated and taken into account in the development of the system. Simulation also enables the investigation of systems or values that are not part of the experimental area or the system under development. Simulation allows for the study of more complicated systems because it generates observations by analyzing probable future changes to the system by looking forward in time, whereas other research approaches aim to look backwards in time to see what happened and how it happened. (Dooley, 2002).
 



3.1.4 Build Methodology
The build research technique will be employed as the research methodology in this project. After considering the various aspects such as the time limit, budget, and complexity of the system to be built, the build methodology is determined to be the best appropriate methodology to employ in the creation of this system. The build research technique entails creating a physical artifact or a software system to demonstrate that something is conceivable; this speeds up the development of the auction system because the system is created as part of the research methodology. This methodology necessitates the creation of a new artifact or the inclusion of new features that have not been demonstrated previously in other artifacts. These new features include the use of a matrix to determine the seller's and the use of a detailed feedback rating rather than the use of positive, negative, or neutral feedback.
Whenever a research issue leads to the development of a software system, the researchers engaged should follow the guidelines below to design the system, regardless of how simple it is. There are several considerations to consider while choosing a programming language, including dependability, expressiveness, run-time performance, and available libraries.
 The build research technique is the greatest fit for this project since the end outcome will be working software, and the project entails creating an artifact that includes new software features, making it the most relevant approach.
 
3.2 Overview of Software Methodologies
In software engineering, a software development methodology or system development methodology is a framework for structuring, planning, and controlling the process of constructing an information system. A software framework is a reusable, universal software foundation for creating applications and solutions. Project planning, requirements formulation, design, development, integration and testing, installation, and acceptance are all steps in the creation of fundamental projects.

3.2.1 Software development phases
The process of creating software is usually divided into several stages. Planning and design, implementation, testing, documentation, deployment, and maintenance are all part of this process.
    •  Planning and designing
This is the beginning of the software development process. In the auction system, the requirements and analyses are obtained from the buyers and sellers. Everything needed for the auction system's development is clarified by the system's many users.
    • Implementation
The system structure is translated into an executable program at this point. PHP is the programming language that is utilized to translate the auction system's structure. JavaScript and CSS are two more programming languages that are employed. The building of an online auction system is possible thanks to the use of these computer languages. The database administration system for this project will be MySQL, and the Integrated Development Environment will be Dreamweaver8 (IDE). A specific programming language will be used to write the program.
    •  Testing
This includes running the system and analyzing any potential faults, as well as taking steps to repair them. Unit testing is one of the ways for testing the system since it examines the various components of the system, such as the system's interfaces, data storage, and how the various selling and buying actions are carried out.
    • Documentation
During this phase, one will be taking notes and keeping track of everything that happens during the development process. The documentation is useful for any system upgrades or changes that may be required, as well as for future reference while performing maintenance.


    • Deployment and Maintenance
The completed software product must be presented to the Computer Science department. After that, the product can be customized to match the needs of the user and put into operation. Faults that have been discovered recently can be cleared, and requirements that have been overlooked can be added.
 
3.3 Software Development Models
There are numerous software development models from which to pick. When constructing this system, we must find the best method for the current project in order to produce a superior end product. This chapter provides an overview of alternative development methodologies as well as a comparison of their advantages and disadvantages. The method that is finally chosen is the one that is most suited to the project at hand.
 
3.3.1 The Waterfall Model
The waterfall model, which was one of the earliest process models to be established and is also known as a linear sequential life cycle, is one of the most prominent models studied in the development of the online auction system. The waterfall model was not chosen since it has a number of drawbacks that prevent the creation of a high-quality end product. Some of its drawbacks include not allowing for much reflection or revision, which is critical in this type of project, and not being ideal for projects with a moderate to high risk of changing needs. As a result, with this process paradigm, there is a lot of risk and unpredictability.
In a linear sequential life cycle model, the waterfall model depicts the software development process. Because changes will not be accommodated as the cycle advances, the waterfall requires that the client requirements are fully understood from the start.



    (a)  Waterfall Model Design
To assure project success, the Waterfall technique will be the first Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model to be extensively utilized in Software Engineering. The completion of each stage in this project is accompanied by the delivery of a document. The entire software development process is broken down into phases. The output of one phase functions as the input for the following phase in a Waterfall paradigm.
      1. Requirement Gathering and analysis
This phase attempts to capture all of the system's requirements and document them in the requirements specification document. This is done in the auction system by gathering needs from buyers and sellers. The purchasers specify details on the things they desire, how they want them to be auctioned, how long each auction will last, and how the bid winners will be chosen.
2. System Design
In this phase, the required specifications obtained in the first phase are examined, and system design is completed. The system design phase describes the hardware to be utilized, which in this project includes the usage of laptops and a server, as well as the use of a localhost server XAMPP as an option. XAMPP is a program that may be installed on a laptop and used to save data. System design aids in the definition of overall system architecture as well as the specification of system requirements.
    3. Implementation
Following the completion of the System Design phase, the implementation phase is the following step. The auction system is built up of separate programs known as units, which are then combined in the next phase. Unit testing is the process of developing and testing each of these units for their functioning.


    4. Integration and Testing
After testing each of the units in the implementation phase they are integrated into the system. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.
    5. Deployment of system
Once the functional and nonfunctional testing is done, the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.
    6. Maintenance
There are a variety of challenges that arise in the client environment. Patches are published to address these concerns, making it simple to solve the problem. In order to improve the product, newer versions have been produced. These modifications in the maintenance phase are made to bring these changes to the customer's environment.
All of the above are connected in a cascade, with progress depicted as a steady downhill flow through the phases, resembling a waterfall. The Waterfall Model refers to the fact that the next phase begins only once the preceding phase's established goals have been met. The waterfall model prevents the stages from overlapping.
 
    (b) Waterfall Model Application
Every software developed is different from the other and requires a suitable Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach to be followed based on the internal and external factors. There are a number of situations where the use of Waterfall model is most appropriate and these situations include where the requirements are very well documented, fixed and clear, the product definition is stable, the technology is understood and is not dynamic, where there are no unclear requirements. The waterfall model also applies where there is a huge amount of resources with required expertise available to support the product and it also requires for the project to be short.


The Advantages and Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model
The advantage of waterfall development is that it allows for departmentalization and control. This allows for the development of a schedule which will be set and has deadlines for each of the development phases and a product can proceed through the development process model phases one by one. Development moves from concept, through design, implementation, testing, installation, error searching, and ends up at operation and maintenance. Each phase of development proceeds follows a consistent order.
Disadvantage
One of the major disadvantages and the reason why the waterfall Model was not chosen for this project is that it does not allow for much reflection or revision. Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well documented or thought upon in the concept stage.
3.2.2 Spiral Model
The spiral software technique was one of the other methodologies we looked into, however we discovered that implementing it would most likely result in the system not being delivered on time. The spiral model uses a risk-based approach rather than a code-based approach, and it employs both top-down and bottom-up techniques (Pinker et al., 2001). The spiral model blends the idea of iterative development with the waterfall model's methodical, regulated characteristics. The spiral model is a hybrid of the iterative development process model and the linear development model, also known as the waterfall model, which prioritizes risk analysis. It allows for incremental product releases or enhancement as each iteration around the spiral progresses. The Spiral model basically tries to combine the features of the waterfall and the prototyping model.
The spiral model consists of four phases. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations called Spirals.
    • Identification
The baseline spiral is used to collect the business needs at this phase. This phase is followed by the identification of system requirements, subsystem requirements, and unit requirements as the product matures. This also includes continual communication between the customer and the system analyst in order to understand the system needs. The product is launched in the identified market at the end of the spiral.

    • Design
Design phase starts with the conceptual design in the baseline spiral and involves architectural design, logical design of modules, physical product design and final design in the subsequent spirals.
    • Construct or Build
At each spiral, the construct phase relates to the construction of the real software product. A POC (Proof of Concept) is developed in this phase of the baseline spiral, when the idea is merely being thought of and the design is being developed, to collect user feedback.
Then, when the requirements and design specifics become clearer, a functioning model of the software known as a build is created with a version number. These prototypes are submitted to customers for review.

    • Evaluation and Risk Analysis
Technical feasibility and management risks, such as schedule slippage and cost overrun, are identified, estimated, and monitored through risk analysis. At the end of the first iteration, the customer analyzes the software and provides comments after testing it.
Based on the customer's feedback, the software development process moves on to the next iteration and then uses a linear strategy to incorporate the customer's suggestions. The spiraling process of iterations continues throughout the life of the software.


Spiral Model Application
Spiral Model is a widely used software in the software industry because it is in line with the natural development process of any product that is learning and maturing while also posing minimal risk to both the customer and the development firm. The Spiral model is commonly used for the following purposes:  
    • When costs there is a budget constraint and risk evaluation is important.
    •  For medium to high-risk projects.
    • Long-term project commitment because of potential changes to economic priorities as the requirements change with time.
    •  Customers are not sure of their requirements which are usually the case.
    • Requirements are complex and need evaluation to get clarity.
    •  New product line which should be released in phases to get enough customer feedback.
    • Significant changes are expected in the product during the development cycle.
 
Advantages and disadvantages of Spiral Model
The spiral lifecycle model has the advantage of allowing product elements to be added in as they become available or known. This ensures that previous requirements and design are not in conflict.
This solution is compatible with approaches that include several software builds and releases, and it provides for a smooth transition to maintenance. Another advantage of the spiral model is that it requires early user input in the system development effort.
On the other hand, completing such items necessitates extremely rigorous supervision, and there is a possibility of the spiral continuing indefinitely. So, in order to design and deploy a successful product, change discipline and the extent to which change requests are accepted are critical.


3.2.3 Extreme Programming
Extreme Programming is the other software methodology we'll look at. Extreme Programming, also known as XP, is one of many Agile Processes. Agile software development is a method for creating software that is iterative and incremental. Extreme Programming's primary benefit is that the entire process is transparent and responsible. The developers will make concrete commitments about what they will accomplish, demonstrate concrete progress in the form of deployable software, and describe exactly what they did and how and why it diverged from the plan when a milestone is reached. This enables business-oriented people to make confident commercial commitments, seize opportunities as they emerge, and swiftly and inexpensively eliminate dead ends.  
Extreme Programming is a software development technique founded on the principles of simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect. It works by bringing the entire team together in front of simple practices with enough feedback for the team to see where they are and tailor the practices to their own scenario.
Communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and boldness are five important ways that Extreme Programming helps a software project. Customers and other programmers are regularly communicated with by Extreme Programmers. Every project contributor is a vital member of the entire team in Extreme Programming. The team is built around a customer service representative who sits with the team and works with them on a daily basis.
Extreme Programming emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. Extreme Programming implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive.
Extreme Programming teams use a simple form of planning and tracking to decide what should be done next and to predict when the project will be done. Focused on business value, the team produces the software in a series of small fully-integrated releases that pass all the tests the Customer has defined.
The Extreme Programming team keeps the system integrated and running all the time. The programmers write all production code in pairs, and all work together all the time. They use a standard coding style to ensure that everyone can comprehend and improve the code as needed.
Extreme Programming is all about team ownership of all code, coding in a consistent manner so that everyone can read everyone else's code, and keeping the system up and operating at all times. The programming team has a common and straightforward vision of how the system should work. Everyone works at a rate that they can keep up indefinitely. An XP project's contributors all sit together as members of the same team. This group must comprise a Customer business representative who delivers requirements, establishes priorities, and drives the project.
There may be a manager, providing resources, handling external communication, coordinating activities. None of these roles is necessarily the exclusive property of just one individual: Everyone on an XP team contributes in any way that they can. The best teams have no specialists, only general contributors with special skills.


3.3 Rapid Application Development
The fast application development approach emerged as the most acceptable way for this project after analyzing the many types of software development methodologies. It is the best methodology since it lowers the cost of production and the amount of time spent on development. Rapid Application Development was determined to be the most acceptable software development process after considering the project deadline, as well as the developer's technical expertise and the project budget. Rapid Application Development makes use of computer-aided design technologies that will be employed throughout the project's development. RAD will be most appropriate for this project as RAD works best for projects whose scope is small and the work should be broken down into manageable chunks Taking into consideration the short timeframe of the project  it would be appropriate to select a software development methodology that allows for the project to be developed over a short space of time. 
 
If an effective development process is followed, rapid development, good quality, and lower costs go hand in hand (Melnik & Richardson, 2010). The functional modules are produced in parallel as prototypes in the RAD paradigm, and then combined to create the whole product for faster delivery.
Because little thorough planning is done ahead of time, it is easier to accommodate modifications into the development process. Small teams of developers, domain experts, client representatives, and other IT resources work progressively on their component or prototype in RAD projects, which follow an iterative and incremental methodology. Th most crucial part of this model's success is ensuring that the prototypes created are reusable.

3.3.1 RAD Model Vs Traditional SDLC
The traditional SDLC follows a rigid process model with high emphasis on requirement analysis and gathering before the coding starts. It puts a pressure on the customer to sign off the requirements before the project starts and the customer does not get the feel of the product as there is no working build available for a long time. The customer may need some changes after he actually gets to see the software, however the change process is quite rigid and it may not be feasible to incorporate major changes in the product in traditional SDLC.
RAD model focuses on iterative and incremental delivery of working models to the customer. This results in rapid delivery to the customer and customer involvement during the complete development cycle of product reducing the risk of nonconformance with the actual user requirements.
3.3.2 RAD Model Design
The RAD model distributes the analysis, design, build, and test phases into a series of very short, iterative development cycles. Below are the phases of RAD.
Business Modeling: The business model for the product under development is designed in terms of flow of information and the distribution of information between various business channels. A complete business analysis is performed to find the vital information for business, how it can be obtained, how and when is the information processed and what are the factors driving successful flow of information.
Data Modeling: The information gathered in the Business Modeling phase is reviewed and analyzed to form sets of data objects vital for the business. The attributes of all data sets are identified and defined. The relation between these data objects are established and defined in detail in relevance to the business model.
Process Modeling: The data object sets defined in the Data Modeling phase are converted to establish the business information flow needed to achieve specific business objectives as per the business model. The process model for any changes or enhancements to the data object sets is defined in this phase. Process descriptions for adding, deleting, retrieving or modifying a data object are given.
Application Generation: The actual system is built and coding is done by using automation tools to convert process and data models into actual prototypes.
Testing and Turnover: The overall amount of testing time is reduced in RAD model as the prototypes are independently tested during every iteration. However, on the other hand the data flow and the interfaces between all the components need to be thoroughly tested with complete test coverage. It reduces the chances of major issues since most of the programming components have already been tested.



3.4 Development Tools
A number of development tools will be used in the creation of our online auction system. The tools that will be employed will ensure that a reliable end product is delivered. The tools utilized are platform agnostic, meaning they can be used on a variety of hardware and software platforms. We used some of the following tools to guarantee that the auction system developed properly. The Integrated Development Environment includes the Unified Modelling Language (UML), PHP, MYSQL, Java script, and Dreamweaver8 (IDE).
3.4.1 Unified Modeling Language
The UML is a graphical notation for documenting software analysis and designs that has become an international industry standard. UML is a standardization and unification of prior modeling notations such as Booch's, Rumbaugh's, Jacobson's, Mellor's, and Wirf- Brock's. UML is an object-oriented technique that makes it simple to convert to object-oriented code. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a language for describing, visualizing, building, and documenting software system artifacts, as well as business modeling and other non-software systems. Non-programmers can comprehend UML's model since it uses simple graphical notations. UML makes use of sequence diagrams, use case diagrams and state chart diagrams’ diagrams are used to show system requirements and the general system design. UML is very important in the use of RAD as it facilitates the development of the project.
3.4.2 PHP
PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used open source general-purpose scripting language that is well suitable for web development and can be incorporated in HTML. Because this project will be conducted entirely online, PHP will be the most appropriate programming language to use. It's a server-side scripting language that allows you to create dynamic web content and communicate with databases. PHP script (which has a syntax comparable to Perl or C) is encased in specific PHP tags in an HTML document. Because PHP is integrated within tags, instead of relying on large amounts of code to output HTML, the author can switch between HTML and PHP (similar to ASP and ColdFusion). 

3.4.3 MYSQL
MySQL is one of the worlds most used open source relational database management system (RDMS) that runs on a server providing multi user access to a number of databases. This makes it suitable for the development of the online auction system. MySQL is a popular choice for developing web applications due also to the fact that it is portable across different platforms.

3.5 Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE)
For the successful development of this online auction and for the delivery of the required functionality and performance to the user, CASE tools are used. CASE tools are software systems which are intended to provide automated support for software process activities and are often used for method support. The CASE tools were used to ensure maintainable, dependable and usable software. The IDE that is going to be used for this project is Dreamweaver8. Dreamweaver8 is an integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports web development technologies such as CSS, JavaScript and various server-side scripting languages. The online auction system will make use of PHP, CSS and JavaScript.


3.6 Conclusion
This chapter analyzes many sorts of research and software development approaches. The construct technique which will be the best research method. This chapter further justifies the decision to use RAD as our software development process and explains the most suitable approaches. Also mentioned are the tools that will be used in the construction of the auction system.
The global competitiveness has brought business change and this change is all around us and the pace is ever increasing. The time to market items or products is decreasing year on year, privatization has brought radical change to public institutions and increased globalization in many sectors has brought the challenge of managing across national boundaries and cultures. Organizational change is now commonplace and given this you might be tempted to suppose that some universally applicable rules would have emerged to guide you when planning a new IT project within a changing environment.
